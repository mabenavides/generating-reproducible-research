Effects of infrastructures for peace
================

## Introduction

Achieving sustainable peace is one of the most relevant global issues
today, especially, since high levels of conflict and violence appeared
to be correlated with stagnant development; however, managing to
transform violent conflict into stable, nonviolent social and political
relationships is a great challenge.

Recently, a new tool for peacebuilding has caught the attention of
scholars and practitioners: **Infrastructures for Peace** (I4P). These
can be understood as a dynamic network of skills, capacities, resources,
tools and institutions that help build constructive relationships and
enhance sustainable resilience of societies against the risks of relapse
into violence (Giessmann, 2016).

Considering the above, on this report, I will explore the variations on
some positive and negative peace indicators (Fragile State Index and
Global Peace Index), on seven countries that have developed
government-lead, national peace infrastructures.

The countries are:

  - Afghanistan
  - Cambodia
  - Colombia
  - Costa Rica
  - Ghana
  - Kenya
  - Yemen

## Analysis of overall scores

These countries adopted at least one of the following infrastructures:
national peace councils, government departments, or peace ministries,
policy and legislative measures creating I4P, or transitional justice
mechanisms. If they were to be effective, we should see an improvement
in the **Fragile State Index** overall score in the subsequent years to
the implementation; nonetheless, as we can see on the graph, this is not
the case for most countries.

*(Take into consideration that a higher score, means worse conditions).*

Only Colombia and Costa Rica seemed to have improve in terms of state
fragility in the years after the implementation of peace
infrastructures. The **Yemen** case is also worth mentioning; it
presents a drastic worsening overtime, even after the adoption of peace
measures.

When considering the Global Peace Index, peace infrastructures do not
appear to be effective, yet again; there is little variation on the
overall scores after the implementation of I4P.

*(As in the FSI case, a higher value represents less peacefulness)*

It is interesting how there is a high variance (0.3291443) among the GPI
scores; countries like Costa Rica and Ghana are, according to this
index, very peaceful, while Yemen and Afghanistan are incredible
violent.

## Analysis of sub-indicators

On the previous graph we see the FSI sub-indicators scores for each
country, in the year after they implemented a given peace
infrastructure. We can see that **Afghanistan** and **Yemen** perform
poorly in all dimensions of state fragility, while **Costa Rica**
appears to be a stable nation.

It also interesting to see that Public Services is the dimension where
countries present a lower score. So we could argue that given the
fragility of these states, they are unable to provide public services to
their citizens.

## Overall transformation

Although we donâ€™t see much improvement after the implementation of I4P,
considering the time frame of the data, some countries have experienced
change over time. Based on the FSI, Afghanistan, Colombia, Cambodia and
Costa Rica have strengthened their states capacity, as we can see from
the variation on the overall score, shown in the following graph.

*Since a higher score means more fragility, a decrease on it, would
represent
improvements.*

The GPI variation also shows some improvements in terms of peacefulness.
But the case of **Yemen** stands out. An increase of over 40% in the
overall GPI score, means that violence and conflict have escalated
tremendously during the last 11 years. It is also worth noting that
**Costa Rica**, although it has presented an increase in the score, it
is considered a peaceful
country.

## Conclusions

This exploratory analysis tried to understand how some positive and
negative peace indicators changed in countries that implemented
infrastructures for peace to eradicate conflict. We saw that the
transformation was not in the expected direction, and that in some
cases, countries performed worse after implementing these peace
policies.

Given that this report only considered countries that adopted I4P with
national coverage, and that were government-lead, we should not conclude
that peace infrastructures in general are inefficient. We advise further
analysis that include other types of policies and indicators that are
more comprehensive.
