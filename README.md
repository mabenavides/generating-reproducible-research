# Generating reproducible research

## Author: Maria Benavides 

For this project, I used the [Fragile States Index](https://fragilestatesindex.org/excel/) and the [Global Peace Index](http://visionofhumanity.org/public-release-data/attachment/gpi-2019-overall-scores-and-domains-2008-2019/) to identify changes on positive and negative peace indicators, in a selected group of countries.
